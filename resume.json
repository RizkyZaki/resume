		"summary": "My name is Ahmad Saugi, a bachelor of computer science student. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.\n\nI am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happens through open-source and I am happy to see what I do could eventually feedback to the community and industry.\n\nOutside of programming, I enjoy reading books. I love the pleasure and excitement of gaining new knowledge other than programming from the books I read.",
